# CloudBot

CloudBot is a simple, fast, expandable, and open-source Python IRC Bot!

## Getting CloudBot

There are currently two branches in this repository:
 - **unfinity** *(stable)*: master branch; contains everything in the **gonzobot** branch plus extra customizations like theming and running suppressed regex events.
 - **gonzobot** *(stable)*: mirrors **[/snoonetIRC/CloudBot/gonzobot](https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot)**

## Installing CloudBot

Firstly, CloudBot will only run on **Python 3.5 or higher** for asyncio and other modules.

Clone the repository and install requirements on [*nix](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix) or [Windows](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows), replacing `CloudBotIRC/CloudBot` with `valesi/CloudBot`.

### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, copy `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the root folder of the project:

```
python3 -m cloudbot
```

You can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3 /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
